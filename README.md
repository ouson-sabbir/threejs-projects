# Three.js Projects

Welcome to **threejs-projects**! This collection features projects built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL.

## ðŸš€ About

This repository showcases various **Three.js** experiments and projects, including:

- 3D models and animations
- Interactive experiences
- Shaders and lighting effects
- Physics-based simulations
- Procedural geometry and textures

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Well-structured code for easy understanding
- Different levels of complexity, from beginner to advanced
- Optimized for performance and compatibility
- Uses modern JavaScript and best practices

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Each project is stored in its own directory with the following structure:

```
threejs-projects/
â”‚â”€â”€ project-name-1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚â”€â”€ project-name-2/

1. Open the project folder of your choice.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Alternatively, start a local server using:
   ```sh
   npx http-server
   ```
